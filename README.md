# Air-Quality-forecasting

1)To Forecast CO2 levels for an organization so that the organization can follow government
norms with respect to CO2 Emissions.

2)Project Architecture / Project Flow

**Understand the Time Series Data

**EDA / Pre-process Data

**Time Series Visualization

**Apply Forecasting Algorithms

**Evaluate & Compare Performance

**Finalize a Model & Implement
Forecast System

**Deployment of the System

3) Data visualization

Inference : A Line Plot Showing Year wise CO2 Emission,Here we can see Earlier (from the year 1800 to 1860) there was constant trend (A Flat line),After that the Trend started to go up Exponentially.

we can also see there is no sign of seasonality(Fluctuations Changes Drastically over the period of time)

So this Timeseries data has an Exponential Trend with No Seasonal Component
